'Play' your thoughts down, as you play the piano. Your thoughts will then turn into a music and enrich your day.\n\n- Specification -\n\n01. The 'Piano' Effect \nPress the effect button first and then drag the texts you want to edit.\n\n02. The Word-Eraser' \nTo deal with typos, simply touch the Eraser once!\n(instead of pressing the Delete button over and over again)\n\n03. Sending E-mails \nDirectly e-mail your thoughts, as you 'played' with beauty and grace.";
